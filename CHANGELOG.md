## [0.0.5](https://github.com/run-at-scale/vscode-terraform-doc-snippets/compare/v0.0.4...v0.0.5) (2018-04-24)

* Source code fixed, though still very hacky in how async is controlled in the main function.
* added github template extras
* snippets are now in alpha order so generating docs will produce valid, ordered diffs.
* cleanup works, woot!

## [0.0.4](https://github.com/run-at-scale/vscode-terraform-doc-snippets/compare/v0.0.3...v0.0.4) (2018-04-24)

* README made whole.
* metadata created to round out project.
* broke source code (but not snippet package) in trying to work through lock issues. Fix forthcoming.

## [0.0.3](https://github.com/run-at-scale/terraform-doc-snippets/compare/v0.0.2...v0.0.3) (2018-04-24)
